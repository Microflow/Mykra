## What can the rest of founders do to increase their odds?

Below are three common knowledge nuggets, very simple, and underrated.

Tell stories: Any great idea should be easy to explain. It may not be obvious how to, but great entrepreneurs always simplify complexity.
No matter how technical your idea you can always turn it into a story.

Be hyper-responsive: Many say it’s human nature to procrastinate. While I agree we’re all guilty of it (myself included) I would suggest it’s a strong 
indicator of lack of interest or incompetence, not nature. Procrastination is easy to fix with advance preparation and prioritization. What’s hard is saying “no” to things that matter but aren’t your priorities. If you‘re taking more than 24 hrs to respond to prospective VC inquiries, then you may not be ready to be pitching them. Stop and reassess your priorities. It’s very rare for a VC to ask questions about your business that you don’t have answers for. If you don’t have answers for questions it’s always best to turn those into learning opportunities vs. trying to fabricate an answer.

**Go deep on “why”?: “Why” is one of the simplest yet the most powerful word in human reasoning. Clearly explaining the “why’s” of your startup will help people believe and trust you. Only the founder(s) will know which why’s to talk about and why. For example: why build this company now? Why will you win? Why are you unique? Etc… It’s easy to take a superficial approach to this and many do. The problem is that doing so shows laziness, lack of motivation, and other negative perceptions.
