## Observations

Met a man selling ginger tea from a tea stand today. He made 3 mistakes:

- He had acne on his face. Dont want to be a jerk and judge him but he couldve worn a facemask or hired a pretty friend to work for him.
- He didnt have clear pricing.
- He was unclear about the product. He was giving samples of tea away, but was only selling ginger sweets, not tea.

If he fixed these problems, I wouldve bougtht a tea. **Presentation, clear pricing, clear product.**
